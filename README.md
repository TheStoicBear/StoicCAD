Hello everyone,

We are excited to announce the alpha release of StoicCAD, our dedicated Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system for the FiveM community.

### Customizable Department Dashboards
One of the standout features of StoicCAD is its highly customizable department dashboards. Each department can tailor its dashboard to reflect its unique style and operational needs. This level of customization extends to themes, layout, and the specific tools available on the dashboard, ensuring that each department’s interface aligns perfectly with its role-play dynamics.

### Technology and Hosting
StoicCAD is designed as a standalone, self-hosted solution that utilizes an Apache/MYSQL server, similar to setups like XAMPP. This means you have full control over your server and data, providing both security and flexibility. Hosting StoicCAD on your local server allows for easy access and management while ensuring that your CAD system operates smoothly and reliably.

### Commitment to Development
As this is just the alpha release and we are only seven days into development, we are actively seeking feedback and suggestions. Your input will be invaluable as we continue to refine StoicCAD and add new features. We are committed to creating a powerful tool that meets the community's needs and enhances the overall gaming experience.

Thank you for your support and enthusiasm. We look forward to evolving StoicCAD together with our community. Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements!

Best regards,
[Your Development Team]
